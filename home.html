                        <p>Welcome to the RGU Music Society!</p>
                        <p>Welcome to the RGU Music Society! This society is a way for people 
                        interested in music to organise with eachother to form events, groups, 
                        or even just talk to like minded people. Maybe you’re looking for people 
                        to study with, or maybe you have an interest but haven’t been able to 
                        start - regardless this is the place for you.</p>
