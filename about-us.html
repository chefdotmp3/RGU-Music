                <h2>What is the RGU Music Society?</h2>
                <p>Welcome to the RGU Music Society!</p>
                <p>While only recently formed, we at RGU Music are dedicated to help those who are interested in music
                    explore all posibilities. We are building with the ability to help you organise venues for your
                    events, for finding like minded musicians to form that group you've always been eager to make, and
                    one to help those who are just getting started exploring this craft.
                </p>

                <p>
                    At RGU Music we understand that music is a social experience, but also how difficult it is 
                    to connect with other musicians coming off the back of Covid-19. To remedy this, 
                    we have many new upcoming events to introduce you to
                    other excited ambitious musicians who are also looking for others so that they can finally
                    start to make the music they've been waiting years to make.
                </p>

                <p>However, maybe you feel you're not quite ready to get out there and play your music yet. This is absolute fine,
                    and we have many members who are more than happy to help you hone your craft, equally, there are many members
                    who find it helpful to learn along with someone else so please feel free to join us if you are just beginning
                    your journey with music!
                </p>
